5.8 Advanced Video Options

‘-rc_override[:stream_specifier] override (output,per-stream)’
rate control override for specific intervals

‘-top[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)’
top=1/bottom=0/auto=-1 field first

‘-dc precision’
Intra_dc_precision.

‘-vtag fourcc/tag (output)’
Force video tag/fourcc. This is an alias for -tag:v.

‘-qphist (global)’
Show QP histogram.

‘-force_key_frames[:stream_specifier] time[,time...] (output,per-stream)’
Force key frames at the specified timestamps, more precisely at the first frames after each specified time. This option can be useful to ensure that a seek point is present at a chapter mark or any other designated place in the output file. The timestamps must be specified in ascending order.

‘-copyinkf[:stream_specifier] (output,per-stream)’
When doing stream copy, copy also non-key frames found at the beginning.

‘-hwaccel_device[:stream_specifier] hwaccel_device (input,per-stream)’
Select a device to use for hardware acceleration.


5.12 Advanced options

‘-map [-]input_file_id[:stream_specifier][,sync_file_id[:stream_specifier]] | [linklabel] (output)’

‘-map_metadata[:metadata_spec_out] infile[:metadata_spec_in] (output,per-metadata)’
Set metadata information of the next output file from infile. Note that those are file indices (zero-based), not filenames. Optional metadata_spec_in/out parameters specify, which metadata to copy. A metadata specifier can have the following forms:

‘-map_chapters input_file_index (output)’
Copy chapters from input file with index input_file_index to the next output file. If no chapter mapping is specified, then chapters are copied from the first input file with at least one chapter. Use a negative file index to disable any chapter copying.

‘-re (input)’
Read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab device or live input stream (e.g. when reading from a file). Should not be used with actual grab devices or live input streams (where it can cause packet loss).

‘-streamid output-stream-index:new-value (output)’
Assign a new stream-id value to an output stream. This option should be specified prior to the output filename to which it applies. For the situation where multiple output files exist, a streamid may be reassigned to a different value.

For example, to set the stream 0 PID to 33 and the stream 1 PID to 36 for an output mpegts file:


avconv -i infile -streamid 0:33 -streamid 1:36 out.ts
‘-bsf[:stream_specifier] bitstream_filters (output,per-stream)’
Set bitstream filters for matching streams. bistream_filters is a comma-separated list of bitstream filters. Use the -bsfs option to get the list of bitstream filters.


avconv -i h264.mp4 -c:v copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -an out.h264

avconv -i file.mov -an -vn -bsf:s mov2textsub -c:s copy -f rawvideo sub.txt
‘-tag[:stream_specifier] codec_tag (output,per-stream)’
Force a tag/fourcc for matching streams.

‘-filter_complex filtergraph (global)’
Define a complex filter graph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of inputs and/or outputs. For simple graphs – those with one input and one output of the same type – see the ‘-filter’ options. filtergraph is a description of the filter graph, as described in Filtergraph syntax.
